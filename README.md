# Javascript-K-Means-Visual
An interactive visualization of the K-Means clustering algorithm in Javascript.

## About
k-means clustering is a method of vector quantization that is popular for cluster analysis in data mining. It is an unsupervised learning algorithm. k-means clustering involves partitioning n observations into k clusters in which each observation belongs to the cluster with the nearest mean, serving as a prototype of the cluster.
## Usage
Simply choose a value for k, pick from a menu of preset clusters or click to draw your own vectors, and click the visualize button.
